# Plotify

A web application used to plot graphs using user provided values, where the user can create, manipulate and save all the progress made.

## Dependencies

### Flask

This project will emphasise on the dynamism of the python language in web developement, as it will be used to run a web application using the Flask framework.

### Bokeh

"Python's native library used to create graphical modulations is Math Plot Library, so this will be used in the project" - that's what i wrote on the first day of creating the repo.
But oh boy, little did i know...
That library came with its own complications, and I had struggled for two days continuously before searching for an alternate.

Fortunately, 'Bokeh' came to help.
Bokeh is one of python's amazing libraries for plotting graphs.
It is very lucid to use and it creates an output webpage by itself. It has more features when it comes to graphical representation. And my code ran :'). What else do i need?

### HTML

For Structure

### CSS

For Design

### JS

For Responsiveness

### I Did it! JGD

omg yes, I did it! (i commented this after the application returned positive tests for the first time after days of brainstorming)
